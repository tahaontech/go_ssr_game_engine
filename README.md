# Worlds First Server Side Rendering Game Engine

The Server Side Rendering Game Engine is a revolutionary technology that enables developers to create and deploy video games that run entirely on the server side. By leveraging server-side rendering techniques and utilizing Golang and WebSockets, this game engine offers numerous advantages over traditional client-side game engines, including improved performance, enhanced security, and reduced client-side requirements.

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: The game engine performs all the processing and rendering on the server using Golang, eliminating the need for powerful client-side hardware. This allows games to be played on a wide range of devices, including low-end computers, smartphones, and web browsers.

- **High Performance**: By offloading the heavy processing tasks to the server and leveraging the efficiency of Golang, the game engine ensures smooth gameplay even on devices with limited capabilities. The server-side rendering approach minimizes latency and provides a responsive gaming experience.

- **Enhanced Security**: With the game logic residing on the server, it becomes extremely difficult for malicious users to modify or cheat the game. This significantly improves the integrity and fairness of multiplayer games.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The server-side rendering approach enables games to be played across different platforms seamlessly. Players can access and enjoy the same gaming experience on various devices without the need for platform-specific adaptations.

- **Flexible Deployment**: The game engine supports flexible deployment options, allowing developers to choose between self-hosting or cloud-based hosting services. This provides scalability and adaptability, ensuring the game can handle high player loads and potential growth.

- **WebSockets Communication**: The game engine utilizes WebSockets for real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients. This enables efficient and low-latency data exchange, facilitating multiplayer interactions, game state synchronization, and real-time updates.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Server Side Rendering Game Engine using Golang and WebSockets, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the game engine repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/tahaontech/go_ssr_game_engine).

2. Install Golang on your development machine by following the official installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Develop your game by implementing the server-side game logic using the provided API and game engine features, utilizing Golang and WebSockets for communication.

4. Test your game locally by running the Golang server. Access the game through a web browser or WebSocket client and establish a connection to the server.

5. Once satisfied with your game, deploy it to your desired hosting environment. Refer to the deployment documentation for detailed instructions.
